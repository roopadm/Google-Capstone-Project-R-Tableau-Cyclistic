Join me on my data-driven journey through the data of Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, we will explore how annual members and casual riders use their bikes differently. Utilize R for data cleaning and manipulation, and Tableau for data visualization, to seek answers to three key questions:

- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
- Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
- And how can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Goal

To uncover insights into rider usage patterns, identify the factors that drive casual riders to become members, and develop marketing strategies that will make it happen.
